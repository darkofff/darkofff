Hi, my online nickname is @darkofff and I'm on a journey to become self-taught software developer. 
If by some miracle you're reading this let me welcome you on my profile. 
I'm going to build a portfolio and make it public here but since i'm just starting 
it's most likely empty or garbage.
Ikd why anyone would read this but if you're one of those let me wish you all the best in life.
